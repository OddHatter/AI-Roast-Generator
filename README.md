Inspired by https://github.com/cbh123/narrator, I used Google's Gemini-Pro-Vision in tandmen with elevenlabs.io API's 
to create an application that will create a short comedic roast of the images subject. The UI is written in flask and is rudimentary, 
but can  be improved upon for specific use cases. I implemented a trusted_IP's list to make sure that usage limits are not uninitentionally hit
when the site is live.
